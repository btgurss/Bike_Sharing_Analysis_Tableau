# Bikesharing

## Overview/Purpose

In this challenge, we are looking into starting a bike sharing business for Des Moines, Iowa.  I will need to create a presentation to give that gives information about how and why Des Moines can sustain this service.  Using Tableau, and data from a similar program in New York City, I was able to create visualizations to give investors an idea of how the business may work.  The ultimate goal is to convince the investors that a bike share program would do well in Des Moines. The visualizations are shown below.

## Results

The following visualizations were created to show the city how and when riders were using the bike sharing service.


### Checkout Times for Users

This graph shows the distribution of ride duration for the bike program.  The majority of the rides were not long.  The graph showed the the most common amount of time spent on the bike was 5 minutes.  This could be how long it took the rider to get to the desired destination.  It was rare the a rider stayed on the bike for more than an hour.  The second and third columns of the graph show the amount of riders spending over one and two hours on the bike. The line shows this did not happen very often.


### Checkout Times by Gender

This graph is very similar to the first graph, except it is specific to each gender.  This graph shows that males use the service much more often than females.  It also shows that people who do not put their gender into the app tend to spend a little more time on the bike.  A graph that compares the usertypes to the trip duration will show that the "Unknown" genders are more than likely the "Customers" usertype.  I would guess they did not take the time to put their genders into the app knowing they would not use it for long.


### Trips by Weekday per Hour
