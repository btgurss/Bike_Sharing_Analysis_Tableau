# Bikesharing

## Overview/Purpose

In this challenge, we are looking into starting a bike sharing business for Des Moines, Iowa.  I will need to create a presentation to give that gives information about how and why Des Moines can sustain this service.  Using Tableau, and data from a similar program in New York City, I was able to create visualizations to give investors an idea of how the business may work.  The ultimate goal is to convince the investors that a bike share program would do well in Des Moines. The visualizations are shown below.
